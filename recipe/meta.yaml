  summary: Gaming meets modern C++ - a fast and reliable entity component system (ECS) and much more
  description: |
    `EnTT` is a header-only, tiny and easy to use library for game programming and
    much more written in **modern C++**.<br/>
    [Among others](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/EnTT-in-Action), it's used
    in [**Minecraft**](https://minecraft.net/en-us/attribution/) by Mojang, the
    [**ArcGIS Runtime SDKs**](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/) by Esri
    and the amazing [**Ragdoll**](https://ragdolldynamics.com/).<br/>
